A Comparative Study of Reinforcement Learning Strategies in the Snake Game


This project aims to develop a snake game from scratch using Python with the Pygame library and implement on it different reinforcement learning techniques in order to compare the results obtained. In this project, I will compare the following algorithms: Q-learning, SARSA, Policy-based algorithm (REINFORCE), and Deep Q-Learning.
